# EBS

#### How it works
<p>Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is an easy-to-use, scalable, high-performance block-storage service designed for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).</p>

-   Attach them to Amazon EC2 instances
-   Placed in a specific Availability Zone
-   Automatically replicated to protect you from the failure 
-   Aurable snapshot capabilities and are designed for high availability
-   Optimize storage performance and cost for your workload
-   Divided into two major categories: 
    -   SSD-backed storage (such as databases and boot volumes )
    -   HDD-backed storage for throughput intensive workloads(such as MapReduce and log processing)

##### General Purpose SSD (gp3 and gp2)

-   Balance price and performance for a wide variety of transactional data

##### IOPS(io2)

-   SAN-like performance in the cloud
-   Procure, scale, and maintain expensive on-premises SANs but not in io2
-   Aachieve sub-millisecond latency
-   Up to 256,000 IOPS, 4,000 MB/second throughput, and 64 TB of capacity
-   4x increase in performance, throughput, and capacity than existing io1 volumes
-   for the largest, most I/O-intensive, mission-critical deployments of Oracle databases, SAP HANA, Microsoft SQL Server, InterSystems database, and SAS Analytics

##### Provisioned IOPS SSD

-   SSD-backed volumes include the highest performance
-   For latency-sensitive transactional workloads

##### Optimized HDD (st1)

-   Frequently accessed, throughput intensive workloads

##### Cold HDD (sc1)

-   Throughput intensive workloads and the lowest cost
-   For less frequently accessed data.

#### Conclution
##### Amazon EBS

-   Allows you to dynamically increase capacity
-   Tune performance
-   Change the type of live volumes with no downtime or performance impact.
-   Easily right-size your deployment and adapt to performance changes
